Train App

This project provides a oneway rail network which connects number of towns. Application is a console application which provides distance to given destination or route, number of routes customers can reach the destination on given number of stops, shortest route between given starting and end towns and different routes from one starting point to another within a given distance.

Getting Started Clone or download the repository from git hub. Application built on .Net Core version 2.2 and used nUnit frmawork for unit testing.

Prerequisites Visual studio (I used Visual Studio Community 2019) nUnit for unit testing

Give examples

Running application

The application provides commandline interface for the user.

initial setup : option 1

At the begining to setup the rail network please press option 1 to create transport network. under option 1 enter routes seperated by commas to create verticies and edges for the rail graph Input template : AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7 To confirm and submit press S. Once graph is created, menu will exit to the main menu without error messages.

Using application

From option 2 - 7 application will provide different options for user

Option 2:

Option 2 will print distance for gien route if it exists. Route sohould be destination seperated by -. Input example : A-B-C

Option 3: Option 3 will provide number of trips starting and end at C with maximum of 3 steps.

Option 4: Option 4 will provide number of trips starting at A and ending at C wih exactly 4 stops.

Option 5: Option 5 will provide shortest route from A to C

Option 6: Option 6 will provide shortest route from B to B

Option 7: Option 7 will provide different routes from C to C with a distance of less than 30.

Error: In each step if inputs are not correct it will throw error with message. Please read them and provide correct inputs.
